          body3: "Which came first—the chicken or the deviled egg recipes? They probably followed each other fairly closely, as it turns out. Boiled, seasoned eggs were served in ancient Rome, when were traditionally served as a first course for lavish banquets. The eggs picked up the “deviled” description in the 19th century. It’s a term that was used to refer to dishes with strong flavors or zesty and spicy additions, such as the mustard and pepper mixed into the mashed yolks. Depending on where you grew up, you might refer to deviled eggs as stuffed eggs, salad eggs or dressed eggs instead. Toppings vary by region, too: They’re often sprinkled with Old Bay® seasoning on the East coast, but paprika is more commonly used in the South.
